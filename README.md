# Breakout
## Simple breakout game using python
The game **breakout**, the idea depends on the presence of a number of blocks, each block contains a certain number of bricks, and the **task** of the **player** is to **meet** the **ball to bounce and collide with the bricks**. 
* 1-when in contact with any brick it shatters and then **increase the score** for the player.
* 2-if the player **didn’t** receive the ball and collides with the ground, the result **decreases** by **2**, and this is repeated in an **infinite loop**, by repeating the descent of the brick blocks, after completing the first blocks.
